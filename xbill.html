        <h2>The Rules</h2>
        <p>
        xBill has been painstakingly designed and
        researched in order to make it as easy to use
        for the whole family as it is for little Sally.
        Years - nay - days of beta testing and
        consulting with the cheapest of human interface
        designers have resulted in a game that is easy
        to use, yet nothing at all like a Macintosh.

        <ol>
          <li>Whack the Bills (click)</li>
          <li>Restart the computer (click)</li>
          <li>Pick up stolen OSes & return (drag) them
              to their respective computers</li>
          <li>Drag the bucket to extinguish sparks</li>
          <li>Scoring is based on total uptime, with
              bonuses for killing Bills.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
        As for the rest, you can probably figure
        it out.  We did, so it can't be too hard.

        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>
        Yet again, the fate of the world rests
        in your hands! An evil computer hacker,
        known only by his handle 'Bill', has
        created the ultimate computer virus. A
        virus so powerful that it has the power
        to transmute an ordinary computer into
        a toaster oven. (oooh!) 'Bill' has
        cloned himself into a billion-jillion
        micro-Bills. Their sole purpose is to
        deliver the nefarious virus, which has
        been cleverly diguised as a popular
        operating system.
        <p>
        As System Administrator/Exterminator,
        your job is to keep Bill from succeeding
        at his task.
